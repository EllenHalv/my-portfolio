## About

This portfolio was created using JavaScript, React, HTML and CSS. It uses React Router to navigate between different pages, which are all responsive by the way! So it will look good on any device.

#### Visit the [live site](https://main.dlhwoui2svit4.amplifyapp.com/) to see it in action!

## Resources

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) Used to create a component-based architecture. The application is structured into reusable components, making the code modular and easier to maintain. React hooks such as useState and useEffect are used to, for example, manage state and effects in the game!
- [CSS/HTML Course by Anthony Alicea](https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-html-and-css/?couponCode=24T2MT070225) I took this course to learn more about CSS and HTML. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to gain deeper understanding in the languages. It's designed to benefit both seasoned HTML/CSS developers and beginners.
- [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) Used to deploy the application. It's a great tool for deploying React applications, as it's easy to use and totally free if you have the Free Tier.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) Used for icons and brand logos.
- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) Used to create the favicon logo and other images on the page.
